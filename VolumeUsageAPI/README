VolumeUsageAPI
-------------------------

*** This is in no way supported by iiNet. This is code that has been written by me, for me that I'm sharing. iiNet will not support this code or is responsible for it ***

My iiNet Volume Usage API implementation.

I wanted to attempt XML Parsing with the native libraries and create an object model to use rather than relying on key references in a dictionary. The end result is an iiFeed object that represents the structure of the XML response but is far easier to work with. 

Sample usage:
    iiVolumeUsageProvider *volumeUsageProvider = [iiVolumeUsageProvider sharedSingleton];
    volumeUsageProvider.delegate = self;
    
    iiFeed *feed = [volumeUsageProvider retrieveUsage];
